# BANK CUSTOMER CHURN MODEL

## INTRODUCTION

This dataset contains details of a bank's customers. The target variable is a binary variable indicating whether the customer left the bank (closed their account) or continues to be a customer.

## OBJECTIVE

### First: Data Exploration and Cleaning
We will explore and clean the data. Deep understanding and thorough data cleaning are crucial for making accurate predictions.

### Second: Data Visualization
We will create numerous visualizations for a deeper understanding of the data. After these visualizations, we will determine if we need to create new variables.

### Finally: Machine Learning Prediction
We will employ Machine Learning Algorithms to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank or not.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
